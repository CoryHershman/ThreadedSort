Sorts a list using a multithreaded merge sort, delegating sections of the list to threads recursively.
Reads in from the text file "input.txt" which is a list of integers seperated by spaces.
Outputs the new, sorted, list to the text file "output.txt"
Both the "input.txt" and "output.txt" are both located in the top layer of the directory alongside the src folder
